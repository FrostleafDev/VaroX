# 0.2 TECHNICAL & DATA SAFETY                                               #
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# Data Safety Note:
# Your game data is safe! All critical information (Teams, Spawns, Game State)
# is automatically saved immediately after every change to ensure maximum data safety.

# You should turn on the 'is flying enabled' option in the server.propeties because
# if not the player will be kicked if he joins back in the air.

# Server Restart:
# The server can be safely restarted during the Varo run without losing progress.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# 0.3 LOCALIZATION                                                          #
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# The plugin includes 5 default languages (de, en, fr, es, ru).
# To add your own language:
# 1. Create a file inside the 'locales/' folder.
# 2. Change the 'locale' option below to your file name.
# Tip: If you want your translation included in future releases, send it to us on Discord!
